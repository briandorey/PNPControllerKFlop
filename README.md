PNP Controller KFlop
==================

This application is a work in progress build to run a DIY pick and place machine via A KFlop motion controller and Windows PC with a custom USB controller board to control feeders and other hardware interfaces. 

The USB controller board prototype is on http://briandorey.com/post/pick-and-place-controller-v3-part-1.aspx

Full details of this project are on my blog at http://www.briandorey.com/

The project was built under Visual Studio 2013.

The project requires KMotion to be installed from

The build path on the project is currently set to: C:\KMotion432\KMotion\Release\ and this would need to be updated to build to the correct folder for different versions of the KMotion software.
